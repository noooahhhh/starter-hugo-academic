* TEAM LEADER
* C++, EMP framework
* This project is the implementation of a working paper.
* We designed a secure distributedversion of the algorithms in a SIGMOD 2011 paper ‘Sampling Based Algorithms for Quantile Computation in Sensor Networks’.
* We designed a semi-honest protocol to protect data sent by each party during quantile summary aggregation using Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) techniques
