I am a third-year undergraduate student student from the School of Cyber Science and Engineering in Sichuan University. 

My research interests include AI security (Adversarial Attacks, Privacy in Machine Learning) and Secure Multi-party Computation. I have had some project experience in these fields during my undergraduate years. Click here to download my [resumé](uploads/resume.pdf).

I’m looking for a summer research internship opportunity in Machine Learning security/privacy or Applied Cryptography. I am available to start working at any time.
